The “#SelinaMandrake” hash tag is a reference to the informal screenplay
https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/[Seline Mandrake - The Slayer]
where I want Ms. Watson to https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html#selina[play the leading role (of Selina)]
and where she is able to slay (or kick the ass of) all the demons without using
a wand or any other form of violence.
